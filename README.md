## Overview
Created a Power BI dashboard to analyze and visualize key financial metrics for a retail business

## Strategic Insights

1- **Capitalize on Growth Segments:** The Channel Partners segment stands out with its strong profit margin. Consider expanding efforts in this segment while improving operational efficiency in lower-performing segments like Small Business and Government.

2- **Optimize Discount Strategies:** With a large portion of sales driven by heavy discounting, evaluate whether this strategy is sustainable long-term. Focus on alternative strategies to maintain sales volume while protecting margins.

3- **Geographical Expansion:** The USA, Canada, and France are key markets for orders, but the USA shows weaker profitability. Investigate cost structures in the USA to improve margins, while exploring growth opportunities in Germany and Mexico.

4- **Product Focus:** Paseo is the top-performing product. Invest in promoting this product further and consider bundling with lower-performing products to drive overall sales growth.
